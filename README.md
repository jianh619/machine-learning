### Linear regression
The implementation of linear regression is linear_regression.py , to test with it 

by changing the value of init value `a and b` and learning rate `rate` , and executing the script as below : 
```
python linear_regression.py
```

If the delta is not small enough , you may need to adjust your learning rate , or increase the loop times
